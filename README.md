## Connecting Spring Applicaiton to MongoDB

Create our Mongo DB Cluster, Database, and Table. Using the db URI, we created a few things:

    - Added a .env file
    - Added a dotenv spring dependency so we could utilize the .env parameters in our resources -> https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/me.paulschwarz/spring-dotenv
    - Set up our Database, cluster, username, password in our .env file
    - Added .env to .gitignore
